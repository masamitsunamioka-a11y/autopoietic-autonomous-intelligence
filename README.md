# Self-Evolving Autonomous Agent (SEAA)
SEAA is a minimalist autonomous engine built on high-cohesion principles. By bridging strict Java type systems with fluid LLM reasoning, it enables an agent to autonomously refine its own directives and extend its capabilities. This is not a framework, but a distilled core for a self-bootstrapping intelligence.
