# Autopoietic Autonomous Intelligence (AAI)

AAI is a research framework exploring self-organizing intelligence via
a pure Java-based architecture.

## Core Research Objectives

The project investigates "operational closure" in AI, where the system
autonomously maintains and evolves its cognitive structure without
manual intervention.

## The Autopoietic Cycle

AAI operates through a continuous four-stage recursive loop:

1. **Infer**: Analyzes complex inputs and reasons through high-density context.
2. **Route**: Dynamically dispatches tasks to specialized neurons.
3. **Upgrade**: Self-modifies directives and spawns new neurons as needed.
4. **Consolidate**: Refines internal state to prevent information entropy.

## Technical Philosophy

* **Pure Java Strategy**: Uses CDI, dynamic proxies, and reflection as
  a rigorous "genetic substrate" for evolving logic.
* **Architectural Autonomy**: Prioritizes Java code generation and
  structural evolution over simple prompt-based interactions.

## Disclaimer

This is an experimental research project dedicated to the exploration
of autonomous, self-productive systems.
