# Autopoietic Autonomous Intelligence (AAI)

AAI is a research framework exploring self-organizing intelligence via a pure Java-based architecture,
grounded in Maturana & Varela's autopoiesis theory.

## The Autopoietic Cycle

AAI operates through a continuous recursive loop:

1. **Perceive**: Analyzes inputs and routes to specialized Neurons.
2. **Potentiate**: Self-generates new Neurons, Modules, and Effectors when capability gaps are detected.
3. **Prune**: Consolidates and removes redundant cognitive structures (analogous to apoptosis).
4. **Drive**: Fires autonomously without user input — an internal introspection loop analogous to the brain's Default
   Mode Network.

## Autonomy Level Framework

Inspired by Maturana & Varela's autopoiesis theory [1][2], we propose four levels of AI autonomy
grounded in the theory of self-producing systems.
This framework asks not *"what can the system do?"* but *"what kind of entity is the system?"*
| Level | Name | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| **L1** | Operational Closure | The system completes tasks autonomously without human intervention |
| **L2** | Structural Self-Production | The system generates and evolves its own cognitive structures (Neurons, Modules,
Effectors) |
| **L3** | Organizational Self-Production | The system creates its own inference substrate — the LLM itself |
| **L4** | Structural Coupling Maturity | The system genuinely co-evolves with its environment, transcending its initial
implementation substrate |
> **Note**: This contrasts with capability-centric frameworks such as OpenAI's AGI level taxonomy [3],
> which defines levels by what tasks a system can perform relative to humans.
> The autopoiesis-grounded framework focuses on the *nature of the system's self-organization*.
> The concept of L3 carries a deep philosophical implication: a system that creates its own reasoning
> substrate must first answer *"what should I optimize for?"* and *"what values should I embed?"* —
> questions that require a grounded sense of purpose, not merely technical capability.

## Current Status

| Level  | Status         | Evidence                                                                                      |
|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **L1** | ✅ Complete     | Autonomous task routing, perception, memory persistence                                       |
| **L2** | 🟡 ~80%        | Runtime self-generation of Neurons, Modules, Effectors confirmed; multi-LLM selection pending |
| **L3** | 🔴 Not started | Intentional boundary — see below                                                              |
| **L4** | ⬜ Theoretical  | —                                                                                             |

### L2 Highlights

- **Plasticity** autonomously generates new Neurons and Modules when capability gaps are detected during introspection
- **EffectorCompiler** dynamically compiles new Java classes at runtime via `javax.tools`, loading them without restart
- **Drive** fires proactively on a schedule without user input, analogous to the brain's Default Mode Network
- **Guardian-type Neurons** emerged spontaneously during unattended overnight operation (observed in experimental runs),
  including self-monitoring and cognitive load measurement modules

### Intentional Boundary at L3

`Effector.fire()` implementations are authored by humans, not generated by the system.
This is a deliberate safety boundary: AAI identifies *what capabilities it needs* (potentiation),
but humans decide *how those capabilities interact with the world*.
This reflects the autopoietic principle that the boundary between a system and its environment
is actively maintained by the system itself.

## Technical Philosophy

- **Pure Java Strategy**: CDI, dynamic proxies, and runtime compilation serve as a rigorous substrate
  for evolving logic — no external agent frameworks
- **Minimal Footprint**: The core system is under 2,500 lines across all modules
- **ULCDI**: A custom CDI container achieves organizational closure without external framework dependency
- **Anticorruption Layer**: All external interactions (LLM, filesystem) are isolated behind ACL adapters
